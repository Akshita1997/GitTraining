1. To create new local repository git is initialized using command - git init
2. Add files, to send it to server using command - git add .
3. To commit the changes done to file, use command - git commit -m "any meaningful message that can explain the commit done"
4. To push the repository on the remote server, first of all local repository must be connected to it by using command -  git remote add origin <server>
5. Now, send changes to the master branch or any other branch of repository byusing command - git push origin master

      By using above steps, code is pushed to the server and can be access by anyone.
